# TextRPG
A Simple Text RPG in Typescript

## How to run

First of all, you need to install all typescript dependencies by running `npm install` (In case of any errors, run `npm install -g typescript @types/node`).

After installing all dependencies you can compile the Typescript code into Javascript by running `npm build`. This will compile all typescript files within _root_ directory.

Now, you may run `npm start` in order to start the game.
